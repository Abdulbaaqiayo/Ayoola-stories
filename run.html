                    <p>“Run”, whispered Judy and Stephnie was off like a flash.</p>
                    <p>She ran straight, turned right, found a closet and hid inside it. She was breathing so hard that anyone can hear her from a mile. Stephnie composed herself and waited with bated breath for it to happen. She heard footsteps coming from the next room.</p>
                    <p>“Where are you” shouted Judy in desperation.</p>
                    <p>Stephnie let out a sigh hearing this and suddenly the footsteps stopped.</p>
                    <p>Help me!!!” Stephnie heard from the other room.</p>
                    <p>Nice try Judy” Stephnie said, “You will have to find me to win you know”.</p>
                    <p>“It was only a game!!! I am really sorry” she head Judy cry.</p>
                    <p>“You are scaring me now Judy” Shouted Stephnie in anger and came out of the closet. It was pitch black in the room and she was finding it extremely hard to see. She tried to adjust her eyes in the limited light which came from the other room and realized the voices have stopped from the other room.</p>
                    <p>Stephnie and Judy had been fascinated with the house since the time they had moved in the neighborhood and used to look for opportunities to sneak in the abandoned house. They finally had their chance 1 night when their parents were out for a party. They had everything planned. They were supposed to sneak in through the window check the house out and return home like they went nowhere. They entered the house as planned and checked if the lights worked.</p>
                    <p>“Nope, there is no fuse, none of the lights work” Stephnie said after checking the fuse box.</p>
                    <p>“Lets play hide and seek Stephnie” Judy suggested.</p>
                    <p>Stephnie thought for a second and agreed reluctantly and said “Sure but lets do if fast. This place gives me the creeps.....”she said.</p>

                <h3>Episode 2</h3>
                <div class="italica">
                  <p>“We shouldn’t have come here” Thought Stephnie while finding her way slowly to the next room where she could make out distinct lights. She felt a hand coming towards her and touching her on the shoulder. She felt a sudden jolt of electricity and was thrown straight inside the closet where she had hidden before.</p>
                  <p>“No, You shouldn’t have” was the last thing she head before everything tuned black in front of her and she passed out.</p>
                  <p>Steph!!! Steph!!!Wake up” she heard someone say.</p>
                  <p>“Judy? What happened” asked Stephnie while trying to get up.</p>
                  <p>“I, I don’t know” replied Judy looking confused.</p>
                  <p>“Let’s get out of here” Stephnie said and took Judy’s hand and walked out with her from the main door.</p>
                  <p>“Strange!!! I could have sworn the door was locked when we tried earlier” Stephnie remarked while moving towards their house along with Judy.</p>
                  <p>“I think a storm is coming” Judy said looking towards the sky. Stephnie looked up and saw that the sky was blood red as well along with the moon. They heard chirping and Stephnie saw there were birds flying around at night with blood red eyes. Somehow they made home and saw their parents car parked outside.</p>
                  <p>“Crap!!! Mom and dad are home!! We are so dead!!” exclaimed Judy while entering the doorway.</p>
                  <p>Both of them stopped dead on their tracks while looking inside the house from the open window. There were people sitting in the drawing room. Both of them turned towards each other in shock and made a face of utter horror. There were their parents along with Stephnie, Judy sitting on the sofa. Judy let out a cry from the driveway which made the 4 people inside the house look at them with their red eyes and in a flash they were standing at the window glaring at them with a dead glaze.</p>
                  <p>It was at that very moment both Judy and Stephnie head a clear voice whisper in their ear….</p>
                  <p>“Run”!!!!…</p>
