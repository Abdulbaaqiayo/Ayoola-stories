                <div class="italica">
                    <p>Three college students named Devin, Bethany and Seth are driving along a lonely mountain road, when all of a sudden, they hit a rock. The car swerves off the edge of a cliff and they plunge into a lake.</p>
                    <p>When they all emerge from the water, they breathe a sigh of relief, happy to still be alive.</p>
                    <p>However, when they look around, they are horrified to see their own bodies, still trapped in the sinking car.</p>
                    <p>Stunned, the three friends swim to the shore and try to figure out what happened.</p>
                    <p>“I know what I saw,” Bethany says. “Those were our bodies in the car.”</p>
                    <p>“When it hit the water, I felt my neck snap,” Devin says. “The next thing I remember, we were in the water.”</p>
                    <p>I don’t remember getting out of the car either,” says Seth.</p>
                    <p>“We must have died in the wreck,” says Devin. “You guys… I think we’re ghosts.”</p>
                    <p>Just then, a truck comes speeding down the road and almost hits them.</p>
                    <p>“Get out of the road, you morons!” the driver shouts.</p>
                    <p>“He saw us!” says Seth. “That guy saw us, so we can’t be dead!”</p>
                    <p>“We are dead,” Devin insists. “We saw our bodies.”</p>
                    <p>“But how could we die and still be alive?” Seth asks.</p>
                    <p>“Nobody witnessed the accident,” says Bethany. “If a tree falls in the forest and there’s no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? Maybe the reason we’re still alive is that we’re the only ones who know that we’re dead…”</p>
                    <p>The three of them go back to college and try to act like nothing happened.</p>
                    <p>"Cheer up,” Seth laughs. “This is the first day of the rest of our lives.”</p>
                    <p>Devin is still haunted by the fact that he has cheated death. He feels like it’s a sin.</p>
                    <p></p>
